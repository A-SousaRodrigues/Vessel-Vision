## Introduction 

The Circle of Willis Learning Game is an interactive, educational platform designed to teach users about the anatomy and function of the Circle of Willis, a critical arterial structure in the human brain. This web-based application combines gamification and user progress tracking to create an engaging and effective learning experience. Users will answer questions, track their progress, and receive feedback to deepen their understanding of the Circle of Willis. Additionally, testimonials from other users will be displayed to encourage engagement and build credibility.

The website will feature a responsive design to ensure usability on various devices and adhere to accessibility standards, making it inclusive for all users.
